Submit a PR if you want to add to the list. Submit a PR if you've implemented a game using the library that doesn't exist right now that will allow a menu and a bunch of useful things for writing games for this console. Submit a PR if you just feel like it. If you've made it thus far then either you're me or really bored. In either case, have you tried reading random Wikipedia articles?
